<h1>Wiseman</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Wiseman</strong> closed his mouth<br>
<em>Madman</em> closed his fist<br>
Young man shows his age<br>
Judge man named it sin<br>
Bad man don't exist, no<br>
No evil man exists<br>
Good man don't exist, no<br>
No righteous man exists<br>
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see<br>
Never witnessed father weep<br>
This old man thought it weak<br>
But strong&nbsp;man don't exist<br>
No undying man exists<br>
Weak man don't exist, no<br>
Just flesh and blood exists<br>
But your mother would be proud of you<br>
I bet your mother would be proud of you <br>
